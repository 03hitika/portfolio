My academic journey has provided me with valuable insights into the dynamic convergence of finance and technology. However, my true passion lies in the world of frontend development. The prospect of creating immersive and user-friendly web interfaces has ignited a desire to transition into coding. This shift represents an exciting new chapter, where I aim to leverage my financial knowledge to craft seamless and visually engaging digital experiences.</p>

I honed my communication and community-building skills, fostering engaged and vibrant online communities. Additionally, my time with an esteemed NGO allowed me to contribute to meaningful projects aimed at creating positive social impact. These diverse experiences have enriched my skill set, and I look forward to applying them in my evolving role as a frontend developer." </p>
